Kisan Seva App
Empowering Small Farmers with Modern Agricultural Solutions

Overview:
Kisan Seva App is a comprehensive, multi-feature web platform designed to tackle the critical challenges faced by small and marginalized farmers. Our solution leverages cutting-edge AI and data analytics to help farmers maximize productivity, improve profitability, and embrace sustainable farming practices.

Key Features:

Tool Rental Service:
Access modern farming equipment on a rental basisâ€”eliminating heavy upfront costs and enabling farmers to use advanced tools only when needed.

Smart Marketplace:
Connect directly with buyers through an intuitive marketplace. Farmers can list their harvest at government-set minimum support prices (MSP) and bypass the traditional market monopoly, ensuring fair compensation.

Crop Disease Detection:
Utilize state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect crop diseases at an early stage. This feature provides actionable insights and timely preventive measures to protect crop health.

Government Schemes & Support:
Stay informed about relevant government initiatives, subsidies, and insurance schemes that support farmers and enhance their profitability.

Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind
Backend: Python (Kerask)
AI/ML: Convolutional Neural Networks for disease detection, and machine learning models for yield prediction
Our Mission:
Kisan Seva App is built with the goal of bridging the technology gap in the agricultural sector. By providing small and poor farmers with modern tools and actionable insights, we aim to transform traditional farming practices, and ensure fair market practices. This integrated approach not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in agriculture.
